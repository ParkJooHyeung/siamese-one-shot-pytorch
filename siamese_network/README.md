## Siamese network for one shot learning

A implementation of the paper : [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf) using pytorch. In the model, somethings, such as learning rates or regression, may differ from the original paper.

You can run one shot learning step by step.

### ðŸš€How to run

All executions begin at the location of `./siamese`. You can execute three action. *just run*, *download-data*, *train*, *test*.

1. #### Run

   This commend automatically executes the entire process according to `config_maker`. If you just want to try this network, I recommend this.

   ```bash
   python main.py run
   ```

2. #### Download-data

   The Omniglot data is downloaded and divided into 30 types of train data, 10 types of validation data, and 10 types of test data. All data is contained in `./data/processed/`.

   ```bash
   python main.py download-data
   ```

3. #### Train

   Only model learning is conducted. If you want to run 'train', you have to run 'download-data' first.

   ```bash
   python main.py train
   ```

4. #### Test

   Only test the model. Stored models and datasets must exist.

   ```bash
   python main.py test
   ```

All parameters are present in `config_maker`. If you want to adjust the parameters, modify them and run the code.
